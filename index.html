                    <p>The U.S. Supreme Court rejected motions to fast-track eight GOP-led lawsuits Monday that challenged President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, including lawsuits led by President Donald Trump and former Trump legal advisor Sidney Powell, effectively killing the post-election litigation by ensuring it won’t be heard before Biden takes office and likely renders the cases moot.</p>

                    <p>The New York State Bar Association said in a scathing letter Monday that it’s launched an inquiry into removing President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani from its membership for his promotion of baseless claims of widespread voting fraud and his incendiary speech to Trump supporters before they stormed the U.S. Capitol—a move that poses no threat to Giuliani’s ability to practice law in the state, but nonetheless stands as a striking admonishment of the former mayor of New York City. </p>
